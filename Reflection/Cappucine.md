# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian.

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as ~<header>~, ~<article>~, and ~<section>~. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to google around a bit before answering!)
Semantic elements clearly define what will be contained in them, and generally define an area of space on the webpage. It is easier for a machine to understand elements when they have specific roles. Therefore any non-human reader of the webpage has more direction. They can increase the site’s accessibility; which is almost essential if you think of the internet as democratic platform that anyone should be able to access. They can be forgotten and the human user would most likely not notice, but they can help in structuring data, convey the meaning of data sets, etc. In terms of accessibility, those who cant visually see the webpage will rely on audio readers, which scan the html and essentially “read it out”. This is where having a structured page comes in handy, as to relay the proper information to everyone disability or no disability. Devices can read the instructions of the page by reading the semantic elements and distinguish what and how to relate it to the user.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.  
The presentation can turn a very confusing and/or boring html page into one that can be easily navigated and appealing to the user. The CSS layer adds not only flare, but lets you really turn text into something else. It can be the difference of someone clicking away or staying, because lets face it; if your website looks sketchy and like no effort was put into it/ if it isn’t very user friendly, you are not going to be successful in keeping people there!
Here is a webpage where not a lot of presentation effort went in

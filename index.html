          Marguerite Porete was a french Mystic who lived from 1248-1310, and is best known for being burnt at the stake for heresy displayed in her book The Mirror of Simple Souls, which dealt with themes of autotheism, worship of oneâ€™s self, and antinomianism. Little is known about Porete, but her story is one that is widely circulated, probably for what is represents. Excerpts of her book were deemed threatening to the Church institution, and her refusal to submit to the Church's demands or admit to lying about writing about God led to her death as a martyr.

          She was not the only Mystic of her time, in fact the high middle ages was a time where many factions of Christianity gathered followings, for example the Franciscans, the Cathars, the Waldensians, the Cistercians, and more. Other individuals, and women, were writing about their interpretations of God as well, like Angela of Foligno and Hildegard of Bingen, however they did not act in defiance to the Church as Porete did. The Church was struggling with their legitimacy among these groups, which practiced Christianity in their own ways. People like Marguerite Porete were very bothersome for the Church. She is also iconic in feminist history, as her gender had a role in her prosecution and treatment by the Church. Her books were burned with her, however copies and translations exist today, luckily, for us to read and examine.
